# The error below might occur if python is < v2.7.9
# "Failed to validate the SSL certificate for repos.influxdata.com:443. Make sure your managed systems have a valid CA certificate installed. If the website serving the url uses SNI you need python >= 2.7.9 on your managed machine or you can install the `urllib3`, `pyopenssl`, `ndg-httpsclient`, and `pyasn1` python modules to perform SNI verification in python >= 2.6. You can use validate_certs=False if you do not need to confirm the servers identity but this is unsafe and not recommended. Paths checked for this platform: /etc/ssl/certs, /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem, /etc/pki/tls/certs, /usr/share/ca-certificates/cacert.org, /etc/ansible"
